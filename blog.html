                <h2>Will AI Replace IT Jobs?: Understanding the Role of Human Expertise </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine going to school your whole life to work for a career you are extremely passionate about just for AI to develop and do everything you do about your job better. Every waking moment we live, it seems the film, The Matrix, becomes more of a reality. We are already witnessing AI automation replacing jobs in customer service, data entry, administrative support, and even transportation! Like everything in life, there are pros and cons to these breakthroughs and it begs the question, will AI replace IT jobs or will human expertise remain in control? 
                    <br><br>
                    AI is great at autonomous, repetitive tasks where it must follow a system under specific conditions. It can take a large load of data and process it into something that the user wants within a very short amount of time. This explains why repetitive jobs are being taken by AI.
                    However, we know that AI can only excel to some degree before it starts to lack the skills that humans have. Creativity, critical problem-solving skills, innovation, emotional intelligence, ethical decision-making, adaptability and personal skills are only a few of the skills that AI lacks. 
                    <br><br>
                    With all that being said, there are still a lot of ways IT professionals can contribute to a world where AI is emerging in technology. Rather than replacing jobs, it is just reshaping the tech industry. First and foremost, adaptability is a skill required by tech professionals more than ever. Since AI is replacing many of their tasks, they either need to learn how to utilize AI, or to do something else that AI can NOT do. Furthermore, soft skills and emotional intelligence is something that AI cannot interpret. Although it can give advice, it will never truly understand the context of reality. 
                    There are many skills one can develop in order to stay indispensable and ahead of what AI can do. AI is simply just enhancing the tech world. It is not about how AI will reign the world, but about how well people can work together with this new technology. 

                <h2>The Rise of AI in Cybersecurity: How Businesses Can Stay Ahead of Cyber Threats</h2>
                    <br><br>
                    With the growing trend of AI in our world, cybersecurity has proven to us that AI is truly a double-edged sword. Since this powerful resource is accessible to the public, it is being utilized by both cybersecurity professionals and cyber terrorists to achieve their goals. Businesses must stay ahead and implement AI-driven security measures to ensure their safety against AI-automated cyber attacks, but what are some ways businesses can protect themselves and how? 
                    <br><br>
                    To fully understand this topic, we must understand the perspectives of both the attackers and the defenders. Attackers can use AI to create convincing phishing emails that otherwise would be easily detectable. Not only will attacks become increasingly sophisticated and calculated, but they will increase in frequency with the automation of AI. On the other hand, the defenders can utilize this same resource to protect themselves from these automated attacks. Through machine learning and pattern recognition, AI can be used defensively to not only identify potential anomalies but also take action before they escalate.
                    <br><br>
                    Almost similar to fighting fire with fire, a business should also invest in AI-powered tools to protect themselves. Mastercard set a great example when they negotiated a $2.65 billion deal with Recorded Future, a cyberdefense firm that leverages AI to detect threats and identify vulnerabilities, to further reinforce Mastercard’s fraud protection. Mastercard’s efforts into maximizing security on their networks highlights the importance of having a formidable defense against AI-powered attacks. Although Mastercard operates on a global scale, small businesses at least having the familiarity with AI and educating their employees will help mitigate risk. With the emergence of AI, it is essential for businesses to stay vigilant and to utilize their resources in order to protect themselves from evolving cybersecurity threats.
