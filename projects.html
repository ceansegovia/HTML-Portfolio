                <h2>Qualcomm Prototype Management Redesign</h2>
                <p>Project Overview:
                    This semester-long project focuses on redesigning communication related to prototype management at Qualcomm. Our team is dedicated to enhancing the efficiency of how engineers communicate, a crucial element that significantly influences the success of prototypes and inventory management, especially concerning racks valued at $2 million.
                    <br><br>
                    To achieve our objectives, we utilize Agile methodologies, employing Oracle for inventory tracking and SharePoint for Scrum management. This project not only offers us practical experience but also strengthens our skills in systems analysis and design within organizations.
