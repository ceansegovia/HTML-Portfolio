            <p>My passion for physics sparked my interest in aviation. I began my journey by pursuing my private pilot's certification while in high school, working diligently to finance my training. Although I've paused my aviation journey for now, the knowledge I've gained is highly relevant in the professional world and has equipped me with a unique perspective that I can bring to any role.</p>
